### Design

* Colour Scheme
    * Hot Vibrant colours have been chosen for my website to suit the mexican theme with a contrast of black (#000) text on lighter backgrounds and white (#e4e4e4) text  on darker backgrounds to make a visually appealing stand out design. 
    * The colour of #ffc800 (a vibrant hot yellow) has been picked as one of the main colours for the header and footer and parts of the main content on the home page, this helps build a recognisable image for the brand and to go with distinct flavours of mexico.
    * To contrast between the yellows background images with blues have picked to give the appearance of blue skys to suit the hot mexican climate.
    * For Hover functions on Villa Pancho logo, buttons and social icons the colour of #468058 which a dark green similar to the green on the mexican flag. This is coordinates with the green on the Villa Pancho Sombrero logo to all tie in appropriately.
    * Elements of reds are also visible throughout the website on the logo & background images as this colour is closely associated with Chillies/Spicy Food.

* Typography
    * The font style of Frijole has been chosen for the website brand/logo (Villa Pancho) within the header & footer. This is a fun distinct font which will be easily recognisable and doesn't take itself too seriously. The idea behind this is so its appealing too a wider audience such as families, young adults and work colleagues.
    * The font style of Playfair Display has been chosen for headings for all pages as its a traditional curvy style to give an authentic feel to the website.
    * The font style of Crimson Text has been chosen for paragraph/menu content as its a easy to read with a traditional feel.
    * All Playfair Display & Crimson Text has been given a letter spacing of 0.05em to make it clear and easy to read across all web pages.
    * The fallback fonts across all webpages is sans serif for any reason the main fonts do not import correctly.

* Imagery
    * The Villa Pancho skull with a sombrero logo is designed within the Headers, footers & centered within the main hero image on the front page to make the brand instantly recognisable along with the Frijole text.
    * The main hero image on the home page is of typical mexican food/ingredients (limes, salsa, sour cream, tobasco, quacemole, etc) This will help identify with the target audience that this website is associated with mexican cuisine. An opaque overlay has also been added to the main hero home image to make the lighter text stand out.
    * On the home page a background image of a cactus is behind the origins & party at Pancho's section as its an important cultural and historical symbol in Mexico. This also has a dark opaque overlay to provide a continuation of style of images for the home page to aid a visual flow and also helps the lightly coloured font within this section stand out.
    * On the home page a background image of a corona/alcoholic beverage has been added to the left of the weekly offers section as a Corona is a instantly recognisable mexican drink. This has been given a rounded radius for a more visually appealing style.
    * On the home page a background image of chillies is behind the testiomonials/reviews section to tie in with the spicy food theme. This also has a dark opaque overlay to provide a continuation of style of images for the home page to aid a visual flow and also helps the lightly coloured font within this section stand out.
    * For the menu page a lightly coloured cactus background image is behind the menu items columns to tie in nicely with the cultural theme on the home page. As the image is lightly cloured the black menu items are easily visible within the slightly transparent yellow columns. The transparent yellow is the same as the rest of web pages (#ffc800).
    * For the menu page a lightly coloured cactus background image is behind the menu items columns to tie in nicely with the cultural theme on the home page.
